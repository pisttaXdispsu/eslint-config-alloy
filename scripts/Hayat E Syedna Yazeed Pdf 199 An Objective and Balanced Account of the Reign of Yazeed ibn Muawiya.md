One of the main objectives of the book is to clear the misconceptions and doubts that some people have about Yazeed and his caliphate. The book argues that Yazeed was not a tyrant or an oppressor, but rather a pious and just ruler who followed the teachings of Islam and the example of his predecessors. The book also claims that Yazeed was not responsible for the tragedy of Karbala and the killing of Imam Hussain, but rather he was unaware and saddened by what happened. The book provides evidence and arguments to support these claims, and refutes the accusations and allegations that are made against Yazeed by some historians and sects.
  
Another objective of the book is to highlight the positive aspects and contributions of Yazeed and his caliphate. The book praises Yazeed for his courage, generosity, wisdom, tolerance, and devotion to Islam. The book also mentions some of the achievements and reforms that Yazeed initiated or continued during his short rule, such as expanding the borders of the Muslim empire, strengthening the army and the navy, building mosques and schools, supporting scholars and poets, promoting justice and equality, and maintaining peace and security. The book also acknowledges some of the mistakes and shortcomings that Yazeed made or faced during his caliphate, such as losing some territories, facing rebellions and revolts, dealing with natural disasters and epidemics, and having a weak administration and succession plan.
  
The book is not only a biography of Yazeed, but also a history of his time and a commentary on his legacy. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the political, social, religious, and cultural aspects of the Umayyad era, and how they influenced or were influenced by Yazeed's caliphate. The book also discusses the impact and implications of Yazeed's rule on the future of Islam and Muslims, especially on the development of different sects and schools of thought. The book also offers some insights and lessons that can be derived from Yazeed's life and caliphate, such as the importance of unity, loyalty, leadership, justice, patience, forgiveness, and moderation.
