The Butterfly Effect is based on the idea that small changes in the initial conditions of a complex system can have large and unpredictable consequences in the long run. The term was coined by Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist and mathematician who studied chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. He famously used the example of a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil and causing a tornado in Texas to illustrate the concept.
 
The movie explores this concept by showing how Evan's actions in the past affect his life and the lives of his friends in different ways. For example, in one timeline, he saves his friend Kayleigh from being molested by her father, but in another timeline, he accidentally kills her brother Tommy. In another timeline, he prevents his mother from having a miscarriage, but in another timeline, he becomes a quadriplegic. The movie also raises ethical questions about whether it is right or wrong to change the past and interfere with fate.
