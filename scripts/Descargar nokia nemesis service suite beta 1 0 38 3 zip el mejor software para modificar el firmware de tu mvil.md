NSS is a software that can retrieve the original product code and warranty data from an online server, as well as change the CSC or the product code through the USB cable connection. It can also load and flash firmwares on the phone, which can be useful if you want to update or downgrade your software version.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use NSS to unlock your Nokia phone in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download NSS
 
You can download NSS from various sources online, but make sure you get it from a reliable and safe website. One of the options is to download it from Archive.org[^1^], where you can find the Nemesis Service suite (NSS) item that contains the zip file. Alternatively, you can download it from Software Informer[^2^], where you can also find more information and reviews about the software.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Install NSS
 
Once you have downloaded the zip file, you need to extract it to a folder on your computer. You can use any zip extractor software, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting the file, you will see a setup.exe file that you need to run to install NSS on your computer. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process.
 
## Step 3: Connect Your Nokia Phone
 
Before you launch NSS, make sure you have installed the Nokia PC Suite[^3^] on your computer, which is necessary for NSS to communicate with your phone. You can download Nokia PC Suite from the official Nokia website or from other sources online.
 
After installing Nokia PC Suite, connect your Nokia phone to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure you select PC Suite mode on your phone when prompted. Wait for the drivers to be installed and for Nokia PC Suite to recognize your phone.
